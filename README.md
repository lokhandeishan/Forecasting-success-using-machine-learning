<h1>Restaurant Success Prediction</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the success of restaurants. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

In this project, we leveraged data from a delivery application to predict the likelihood of a restaurant's success. The key steps undertaken include:

- Data preprocessing and exploration.
- Feature engineering, encoding, and selection using pandas and numpy in Python.
- Deployment of machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- Visualization of results using libraries like Seaborn and Plotly.
